	<p class = 'myStory'> Honestly, I have felt overwhelm to think what to do for my life 
		since I graduated college.
		Fortunately, I could find <b>my true passion</b> which is <b>web development.</b> 
	    But, web development is not something related to my major, <b>Business Marketing.</b>
		I am not afford to go back to school for that, so I <b>learn</b> most of them <b>myself</b> from online course,books, any kind of resources I could find, 
		and I think that’s the best way. I am still learning and <b>enjoying learning new things</b> everyday.
		Recently, I realized that I would learn more from <b>real work experience</b> and I decide to <b>look for a job</b> as web developer.
		<b>I am aware</b> that I don’t need to wait for the perfect moment to start doing something I really like. 
		<b>This site</b> is showing some pieces of what I can do.
